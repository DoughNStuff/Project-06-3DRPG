# Project-06

# Features added
My project features a player with a unique model and a camera that follows. The player model is animated and has an animation you can use with Q. The player also has a hand-held sword that tracks with his hand. There is a character you can talk to and interact with. There is an objective. I was not able to get the switch from interacting with the sword to going to the end screen but I gave the game a relatively unique ending regardless.
